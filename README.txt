Hi!
I started this project because I was in a bit of a creative slump, so might well do a more obvious/generic (but still fun) project.
I have scraped the complete works of William Shakespeare from https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.006/s08/lecturenotes/files/t8.shakespeare.txt
and tokenized the data. I cleaned everything up (removed punctuation, newlines, etc.) and stored it as a JSON. The JSON is structured as 
a dictionary of lists, each key being the name of the play/work, and each value being a list broken up by word (ie. [the, quick, brown, fox]).

I will be posting any interesting data findings to here, and perhaps the tokenized shakespeare JSON could be helpful to someone for training
data or something of that sort. I think I will likely do something similar for the complete Harry Potter series to compare to in the near future
as well.
